<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Introduction
Firstly,some self-introduction: I am currently(2021) an undergraduate student at SJTU,China. Personally, I am very disappointed in the curriculum as well as the teaching in my department. Due to my passion toward computer science, I've decided to learn computer science all by myself, hence the title **CS-Self-Rescue-Manual**. A lot of renowned universities have shared numerous courses online and I've put them togethem for a complete learning program. Hope you Enjoy!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Preparation

<details open>

Before getting into any details about CS learning, I first want to share my two cents on learning itself.
- **When learning, always be aware of what your goal is**, and then selet resources and make study plan accordingly. Reading this manual, you may have various purposes ranging from desiring to conquer a problem during work while lacking knowledge on certain fields to simply wanting to improve your GPA. If you just want a better score, I suggest you put most of your time on class materials from your teacher and try to get exam problems from past years. However, if you care more about learning computer science systematically from the best professors, I suggest you go through this manual carefully and choose courses you want to learn from every topic.
- **Dive directly, Start immediately.** Translation: If you want to learn something, dive directly in that topic and then come back for things you don't understand;Start the learning process fast, change plan afterwards. This maybe somewhat adventurous and agressive, but it's the way to learn most efficiently.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>
</details>

### Online Resources

<details open>

There are already many projects about learning CS by yourself online, so first I am going to list some of the best projects that I've taken reference. Thank you for the inspiration.
- [MIT Challenge by Scott H. Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)
<br />
  This is the first project that I've come across while searching for resources. The arthor finished all MIT CS undergraduate courses in merely one year. Definitely make sure you check out his learning experience and his mindset while learning, which I find most helpful.

  He's also written several books about learning and I've taken several advice from his book [Ultralearning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/). You can also check [my note on Ultralearning](Other%20Resources/Ultralearning%20Notes.pdf). 

- [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com) (A very detailed and structured guide.)
- [CS-Self-Learning](https://csdiy.wiki) (Written by a PKU undergraduate, very comprehensive.)

Then I am going to list some common websites to find online courses you need. Props to all the universites and organiztion for sharing the knowledge online!
- [Libgen](https://libgen.rs)
  (The website to find ALL e-books.)
- [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.html)
  (Include almost every course in MIT. However, video lectures aren't available in every course.)
- [MIT Open Library](https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library)
  (Selected courses from MIT OCW, reconstructed for better online learning)
- [Stanford Engineering Everywhere](https://see.stanford.edu/Course)
  (Stanford online learning program, however there is only a few courses.)
- [Coursera](https://coursera.org)
  (Popular online learning website. However a lot of courses are much easier than actually taught in class)
- [Edx](https://edx.org)
  (Similar to coursera. Most courses are from MIT and Harvard)

A lot of other great courses are hosted on an individual website. You can first get the course number from the following websites and then search for course material on [Google](https://www.google.com), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) or [Bilibili](https://bilibili.com).
- [MIT Course List](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m6a.html)
- [UC Berkely Course List](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS/?_ga=2.49145060.370293363.1598336094-476512950.1598336094)
- [CMU Course List](https://csd.cmu.edu/cs-and-related-undergraduate-courses)
- [Stanford Course List](https://www.classcentral.com/report/stanford-on-campus-courses/) (Paired with links to course pages)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- ROADMAP -->

### Roadmap

<details open>

After having access to all the online resources, you still need to make a more detailed plan to study systematically as some of the courses have dependencies. Gladly, a lot of the universities have again shared their CS program roadmap. The picture below is the roadmap from MIT:
<br />
<div align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/Clover-Hill/CS-Self-Rescue-Manual">
    <img src="images/MIT_6-3_roadmap_image.jpg" alt="Roadmap" width="600" height="450">
  </a>
</div>

Here are more roadmaps from other universities:
- [UC Berkely Roadmap](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/courseguides) (Interactive website!)
- [CMU Roadmap](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/undergraduatecomputerscience/#bscurriculumtextcontainer) 
- [MIT Roadmap](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/) (Of another format.)

Since [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.html) has the most courses paired with video lectures, this manual will mostly follow its roadmap, and then paired with other courses for supplement.

With all the resources mentioned above, I can safely say that you can make your own learning program now customized for your goal. Feel free to fork this repo and make your own roadmap, and don't forget to leave this project a star :star_struck: .

Calculus, matrix manipulation and probability are mandated. However, I believe some exposure to rigorous math is helpful for future learning, therefore some books about analysis and advanced algebra will also be recommended. After that, you can select topics based on your interest and time.

<!-- Natrue Science -->
## Nature Science
### Intro
In the MIT Program, two physics courses, one chemistry course and one biology course are mandated. It's true that interdisciplinary fields are becoming more and more popular and promising, I hold the view that an introductory level of knowledge on nature science is enough for a student aimed at Computer Science. In the future, if you are interested in a particular field, just learn it by then. You can't learn everything, PRIORITIZE your time!

Therefore, I will only list some introductory course below.
